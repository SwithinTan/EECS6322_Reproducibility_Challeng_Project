# EECS6322 Reproducibility Challeng Project
There are two main verifications of the original paper to be made in this reproduction project.

1. The first is to verify if the data augmentation could improve the generalization of the model.
2. The second is to verify if training with more diverse dataset could improve the generalization of the model.

## Data Augmentation

### Training

### Testing
