EECS6322 Reproducibility Challenge Final Report

## Main Contribution

In the paper, the main contributions are:

1.  They introduced a new approach to detect CNN-generated images, by training forensics models on CNN-generated images. This approach shows a surprising amount of generalization compared with other CNN systhesis methods. 
2. They introduced a new dataset and evaluation metrics for detecting CNN-generated images.
3. They experimentally analyzed the factors that account for cross-model generalization.
